<p>For this homework I learned a bunch and even benefited from some of the excercises sometimes when I would make webpages I would ask myself how can i make the image more smaller not needed to do much css and now I can! I honestly used all of the 4/6 of the image compression the instructor gave us but seen a big difference when using <a href="https://jpeg-optimizer.com/"> JPEG Optimizer.  </a> </p>
<p> Using the Chrome Developer Tool is something new learned and when using to reload I seen a difference of about 1ms which may not seen much but it is a big change. </p>
